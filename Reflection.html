                When I was young, I listened to funk and 70s music in the car with my mom as we were driving places, tuning in to 105.7 THE WALRUS every day and enjoying the beauty and energy. I loved the sunshine band, tom petty, boogie nights, to name a few.Looking back, I love it not just for nostalgia's sake, but for high quality the songs are. I got to experience, and fully enjoy as if I was there, the music of the sixties, with their beautiful swing and ballads, the seventies, with their fantastic funk and dramatic disco, and eighties rock songs from my father.    They were all so happy and funky, energetic and powerful, moving and emotional, and  the little child  I used to be loved them. When I got into middle and early high school, I started to listen to the background music of videogames, such as mario, zelda, and rayman, and I am swayed by the emotions in the music. Each games style may be completely different,  some may be electronic, jazzy, orchestrated, terrifying, even tragic. Truly, the limits seemed endless, and I could listen to any new game and discover a whole new sound, style, and emotion. The adventure, the energy, the emotions, all enchanted me, and I would just listen to the music as it took me to the world. Lately, I have been listening to a new genre of music called Electro Swing, which is a combination of swing music and electronic music. It is very energetic, melodic, and really new and interesting. It is so much fun to share as I see it grow in popularity. There are a few bands, such as parov stelar, who creates techno remixes of many old songs and creates new swinging beautiful songs out of them, peggy swave, who makes songs that are more energized and pop song like. My favorite band is currently caravan palace, a jazzy, stylish, and ranging from slow to dramatic to energetic and fiery. I am so glad I have been able to catch with this latest trend.<br><br>

                If I could freeze a moment of time I would freeze a moment in sacramento california at the summit of my youth in Gov program. In my youth and government program, we imitate the california legislature and court system. The first year, I acted as a bill sponsor, the person who creates and introduces a bill to the houses of senate and assembly. That year, I achieved so much, made so many friends, and felt truly great. The second year, I was in the court program, and I was a defence attorney, defending my client and making examinations, eliminating witnesses, and stating my case. After our victory, the judge mentioned that it was my impeachment of the witness that clinched victory for my team. Everyone was so proud of me at that moment, and I once again I felt so glowing with pride. The third year, I was a lobbyist, and was the person who helped to argue for bills in the commitee rooms where it was decided which bills went to the senate floors. The final year, I was in the board of education, and made mty own school. At the end of each year, there was a moment where we all come together to appreciate each other. It is in that moment where I am literally surrounded by people that love me and support me and I have friends that care in every direction. In that moment, I am so cared for, so reassured, so appreciated that I would ask for no other moment, and had in that moment what some people seek their entire moments for and never find. I would be a fool to do anything else but recognise the magic of that moment and honor it as such.<br><br>
