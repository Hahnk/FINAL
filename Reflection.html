                When I was young, I listened to funk and 70s music in the car with my mom as we were driving places, tuning in to 105.7 THE WALRUS every day and enjoying the beauty and energy. I loved the sunshine band, tom petty, boogie nights, to name a few.Looking back, I love it not just for nostalgia's sake, but for high quality the songs are. I got to experience, and fully enjoy as if I was there, the music of the sixties, with their beautiful swing and ballads, the seventies, with their fantastic funk and dramatic disco, and eighties rock songs from my father.    They were all so happy and funky, energetic and powerful, moving and emotional, and  the little child  I used to be loved them. When I got into middle and early high school, I started to listen to the background music of videogames, and I am swayed by the emotions in the music. The adventure, the energy, the emotions, all enchanted me, and I would just listen to the music as it took me to the world. Lately, I have been listening to a new genre of music called Electro Swing, which is a combination of swing music and electronic music. It is very energetic, melodic, and really new and interesting. It is so much fun to share as I see it grow in popularity<br><br>

                If I could freeze a moment of time I would freeze a moment in sacramento california at the summit of my youth in Gov program, a moment where I am literally surrounded by people that love me and support me and I have friends that care in every direction. In that moment, I am so cared for, so reassured, so appreciated that I would ask for no other moment, and had in that moment what some people seek their entire moments for and never find. I would be a fool to do anything else but recognise the magic of that moment and honor it as such.
