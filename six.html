                You can’t afford not to care.<br><br>

                Caring seems very simple. Very easy. Something for kids books to point at and say how great it is. Something for rainbow bears to chant in cheesy nineties television shows.  But let me tell you that caring is a lot more important and universal than some people would have you believe. Care, in a lot of ways, is just conscious thought. When your friend asks you what pizza toppings you would want, and you respond “I don’t care” what you mean is that you are deciding to not think about it anymore, you would be completely unaffected by any outcome possible. Then, your friend returns with pineapple anchovy pizza and you decide after all that you actually do really care about what your friend expects you to enjoy eating. What is usually ignored is that caring does not have to be for another person in need. Sympathy is something beautiful, but caring is a much bigger and more important concept. It is not just thinking, it is also feeling, and acting. If you say that you care about not being hit by a train, it would imply that you stand up and get off of the train tracks. That same principle applies to everything in life, and it can do so much if you decide to care. I mean decide, too. Someone walking down the street with a sad expression, a person in your math class who is failing and is having trouble understanding, someone needing a friend. To them, just someone to show caring could mean so much. It could mean the difference between someone to talk to, and nobody to talk to. It could mean someone having the worst day of their life and having the worst day of their life alone. It could mean the difference between them having someone that cares when they feel that they would not deserve it, or going out into the world believing that the world is cold, cruel, and lonely, where nobody cares. And they go out into the world, saying, “Why should I care?”<br><br>

                You can’t afford not to care.<br><br>
